		<blockquote>"Design is not only how it looks but also how it works." - Steve Jobs</blockquote>
		<p>As an architect I learnt that good design has to functionally and aesthetically delight its users. I enjoy collaborating with talented, enthusiastic people to see a project from ideation to completion.</p>
		<p>As an internet user, I am continually  amazed by how it is constantly reshaping our lives.  I am excited to translate my creativity to this revolutionary medium. My goal is to join a caffeine fueled start up working towards changing the world where I can make a difference one design at a time.</p>
